# rf-pre

Early-signal intelligence for municipal capital projects.

Public agencies decide to build things long before they publish a solicitation.
That intent is visible in council agendas, capital facilities plans, and staff
reports — sometimes years ahead. This project reads those public documents and
turns them into scored, sourced signals.

**Scope:** Washington State, water and wastewater.

## Signal ladder

| Tier | Signal |
|---|---|
| 1 | Casual mention |
| 2 | Feasibility study or comprehensive plan commissioned |
| 3 | Budgeted line item in a capital plan |
| 4 | Design or construction contract awarded |

Every signal carries a verbatim quote, a link to the source document, a page
reference, and the meeting date. Provenance is a requirement, not a feature.

## Approach

Agency documents are public by law but scattered across vendor platforms with
inconsistent structure and no common interface. The collection layer is built
to notice when a source changes shape and repair itself, so the pipeline keeps
running without hand-maintenance per agency.

## Status

Early. Corpus selection and pipeline validation in progress. Nothing here is
production-ready.

## Development

Everything runs in Docker; nothing is installed on the host.

```bash
docker compose watch   # start both services with live reload
docker compose down    # stop
```

- API — http://localhost:8000 (`/health`, `/docs`)
- Web — http://localhost:3000

`docker compose watch` copies changed files into the running containers rather
than bind-mounting the working tree, so build artifacts (`.next`,
`node_modules`, `__pycache__`) stay inside the containers and never land in
your checkout.

### Adding dependencies

```bash
make add-py pkg=httpx    # Python
make add-js pkg=zod      # Node
docker compose build     # rebuild images with the new dependency
```

The Makefile exists only for these three: the underlying `docker compose run`
invocations are long, and the `--user` flag they need on Linux must be omitted
on macOS. `make lock` regenerates both lockfiles after a manual manifest edit.

`api/uv.lock` and `web/pnpm-lock.yaml` are committed and the images install
frozen, so builds are reproducible across machines.
